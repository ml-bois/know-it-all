# Know It All 

This is the (frontend) for our `know-it-all` app, an AI chatbot who makes up things to outsmart you.


It's built with jekyll. So, [install it](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).

It should be running at [http://ml-bois.github.io/know-it-all](http://ml-bois.github.io/know-it-all)
